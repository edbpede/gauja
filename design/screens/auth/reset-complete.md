# Complete password reset

## Contract

Screen ID `auth/reset-complete`, phase 5.2. Entry and exit remain scoped to the selected profile. Auth surfaces are native forms/sheets except the explicitly external Plex system browser. Reference contract: Seerr v3.4.1 at `69f73a6f1486fdb51b8ddae9a94a8dfb629f461c`.

## Content

Server/profile context, new-password and confirmation secure fields, and invalid/expired link state. Never display the reset GUID in diagnostics.

## States

- **Loading:** disable duplicate submit; preserve the profile label and permit cancellation. Refresh retains valid content.
- **Empty:** first-use fields or no profiles show the next action; an empty configuration does not enable an unsupported login method.
- **Error:** show an actionable, redacted error and retry/alternate method. Preserve non-secret draft values; never interpolate raw HTTP bodies, credentials or GUIDs.
- **Offline:** explain that sign-in, validation and server writes need connectivity. Existing per-profile cached reads may remain available with staleness; no queued mutation is silently replayed.
- **Permission-denied:** explain server rejection/config restrictions and offer the permitted alternate method or profile list. A 403 does not erase other profiles or their sessions.

## Actions

Validate matching nonempty passwords and submit password with the supplied guid. Respect server validation; on success clear the draft and return to sign-in. Route parsing may land in Phase 4/5, but OS registration is Phase 11.

All network requests carry an immutable attempt/profile identity; cancel and ignore results when that identity changes. Secrets are transient secure input and then SecretStore/Keychain only, never saved-state payloads, logs, fixtures or diagnostics. Error handling never broadens TLS trust or follows a credential-bearing redirect to another origin.

## Adaptive behavior

Compact: native form/sheet and stacked back navigation. Medium: bounded readable form width using size classes. Expanded: profile list/detail uses native adaptive scaffolds; auth forms stay associated with the selected profile. Resizing or folding preserves non-secret draft/selection, never starts a second auth attempt. The system back gesture cancels the current attempt.

## Accessibility

Secure input labels identify the credential and server. Announce validation/pending/expiry without reading secret values. Support keyboard submit/focus order, native 48 dp/44 pt targets, largest Dynamic Type/font scaling and reduced motion. Fingerprint/code can wrap and remains selectable only where explicitly safe; never copy the Quick Connect secret.

## Endpoints

POST /auth/reset-password/{guid}. Paths are relative to `/api/v1`. Request/response shapes come from the effective spec. Authenticated requests go to the profile’s Seerr origin only; cookies never cross profiles.

## Permissions

A reset GUID scoped to the correct server; no session required. Never infer the server from an untrusted host without profile matching.

## Content components

Native form, secure field, progress indicator, alert and action button primitives from DesignSystem. Profile/status warnings may use StatusBadge semantics. No content-media card is required for sign-in. Component behavior follows `../components/INVENTORY.md`.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass auth matrix rows **A22, A23** on Android and iOS. Exercise all five states, cancellation/late responses, a second profile with different credentials, compact/expanded resizing, largest text and screen-reader traversal. A successful auth result is not activated until auth/me succeeds. Existing cached reads meet the ≤300 ms offline target; no background work is introduced. Implementation tests belong to phase 5.2; this specification does not claim those runtime tests have passed.
