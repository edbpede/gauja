# Contributing to Gauja

Gauja is two independent native apps (Kotlin on Android, Swift on iOS) that share only a contract (`api/`, `design/`). Read `docs/gauja-prd.md` for what and why, `docs/gauja-implementation-plan.md` for the order of work, and the rule files in `.agents/rules/` for how code must be written. The rule files are normative and win over both documents.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Every commit must be signed off:

```bash
git commit -s
```

The sign-off certifies the [Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/) for that commit. There is no CLA; you keep your copyright.

> The license of this project is the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 or (at your option) any later version, **together with** the additional permission set out in `APPSTORE_EXCEPTION.md`. Every reference to "the license" in this repository, including in SPDX headers and in the Developer Certificate of Origin, means the AGPL together with that additional permission.

By signing off you license your contribution under AGPL-3.0-or-later together with the App Store Distribution Exception. The `commit-messages` CI check is required on every pull request: it verifies that every commit is signed off and that the sign-off email matches the author or committer. The local `dco-signoff` hook rejects unsigned commits before they leave your machine.

## Local hooks (prek)

[prek](https://prek.j178.dev) runs the hooks in `prek.toml` on `pre-commit` and `commit-msg`.

```bash
tools/contract/python.sh --install  # pinned build-only contract dependencies
prek install            # once per clone: installs both shims
prek run --all-files    # after changing prek.toml, or before opening a PR
```

Install prek from https://prek.j178.dev/installation/ (`brew install prek`, `uv tool install prek`, or the install script).

[prek.toml](prek.toml) owns hook commands, path filters and generated-file exclusions.
It covers file hygiene, commit conventions/sign-off, secrets and the relevant contract/design
checks. The platform hooks become applicable with handwritten app sources.

Formatting and lint hooks for one platform need that platform's toolchain. If you only work on Android, the iOS hooks skip because no Swift files are staged, and vice versa.

The scripts under `tools/` have tests: `tools/tests/run.sh`. Translation tooling lands with real catalogs. Resolved-dependency license checks run in each app lane; the policy is in `deny.toml` and the review procedure in `docs/dependency-license-review.md`.

## Licensing headers (REUSE)

Files carry SPDX copyright and license information, either as headers or through `REUSE.toml`. Gauja contributions retain AGPL-3.0-or-later with the App Store permission; inherited material retains its upstream attribution and notices. See [third-party provenance and distribution responsibilities](docs/THIRD_PARTY.md). CI runs `reuse lint`; run it locally with `pipx install reuse` / `brew install reuse`. Resolved-dependency license enforcement against `deny.toml` is separate from REUSE.

## Branches, commits and pull requests

- Never commit to `main`; branch from it with a `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `chore/` or `ci/` prefix.
- Conventional Commits, one logical change per commit, every commit signed off.
- One module, one screen or one hook per PR where practical. Link the owning behavior contract (a file or inventory section) for UI changes; refine its applicable acceptance criteria with the feature.
- Put meaningful behavior tests near the owning sources; do not create empty suites or require a file per type.
- Generated code (`apps/android/core/api/`, `apps/ios/Packages/SeerrAPI/Generated/`, generated themes) is never hand-edited. Regenerate with `tools/codegen/` or `tools/tokens/`.
- `main` is protected: squash-merge only, the PR title becomes the commit subject, and the `REUSE`, `prek`, `commit-messages`, `gitleaks`, `tool-tests` and `boundary` checks must pass.
- Nothing under `apps/android/` may reference `apps/ios/` or vice versa. Artifacts flow from `api/` and `design/` into the apps only.

## Building one platform without the other's toolchain

Each app is a complete, standalone build. Only `api/`, `design/` and `tools/` are shared inputs.

- **Android only:** JDK 17 and Android SDK 37. `cd apps/android && ./gradlew assembleDebug testDebugUnitTest detekt ktfmtCheck lint`. No Xcode needed.
- **iOS only:** Xcode 26 with the Swift 6.3 toolchain, XcodeGen 2.46.x, SwiftLint 0.65.x. `cd apps/ios && xcodegen generate` then build and test from Xcode or `xcodebuild`. No JDK needed.

The initial apps check `/status` and `/settings/public` without saving profiles or signing in.
For Android, install the SDK package `platforms;android-37.0` and set `ANDROID_HOME`
or ignored `apps/android/local.properties`. For iOS, copy `Package.resolved` into
`Gauja.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/` after XcodeGen generation.
Command-line builds use `-skipPackagePluginValidation` for the pinned SwiftLint plugin.
See the platform workflows for complete commands and [contract tooling](tools/codegen/README.md)
for independent generated-client tests. With one toolchain installed, use `SKIP=swift-format,swiftlint`
(Android) or `SKIP=ktfmt,detekt` (iOS) for a repository-wide hook run; staged platform work
skips the other platform naturally.

## Reporting security issues

See `SECURITY.md`. Never open a public issue for a vulnerability.

Routine navigation/search should respect `.gitignore` (for example, `rg` or `git ls-files`). Keep `.cache/` and SwiftPM `.build/` dependency trees hidden in editor navigation; do not prune individual dependency files.
